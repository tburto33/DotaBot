# dotaBot
This is just a simple Discord bot I am working on for myself and friends to use. Calling the bot in our discord server and giving it basic commands,
it will pull data from the OpenDoTA API specific to that person. Mainly it pulls statistics we like to know to help improve our skills at DoTA 2.
*Currently a private bot only*
